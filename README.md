# Nordic-Genome
Here you can find my latest setup, on Windows 10. Feel free to create an issue if you'd like to add something

NOTE: These dots are intended for my setup. If you wish to use them (and feel free to take them and tinker around), you will have to make specific modifications
for your own machine. I'll do my best to answer questions related to parameters that may need to be changed

Thanks to [Barbarossa93](https://github.com/Barbarossa93) and his [Genome](https://github.com/Barbarossa93/Genome) setup

Also thanks to niivu for doing the majority of the work with the Nord Windows theme
